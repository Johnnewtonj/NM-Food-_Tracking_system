# NM-Food-_Tracking_system

The food industry is undergoing a significant transformation, with increasing demand for transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain. Food safety, authenticity, and sustainability are paramount concerns for consumers, regulators, and producers alike. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable ledger, offers a promising solution to address these concerns. This paper presents a novel approach to implementing a food tracking system using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The proposed system leverages Ethereum's smart contract capabilities to create a transparent and secure platform for tracking food products from farm to fork. Each food item is assigned a unique digital identity, and its journey through the supply chain is recorded on the blockchain. This digital ledger ensures data integrity and enables real-time access to critical information such as origin, processing, and transportation details.
